      <h1>Picture Frame</h1>
      <p>A picture frame I built for a friend. Made using a wardrobe he gave me to salvage wood from.</p>
      <p>Completed on 31/03/2017.</p>

        <p>I got all the wood for the frame by ripping this section from the base of the wardrobe.</p>

        <p>The most boring part of the project was sanding all the finish of, sanding concave curves isn't fun.</p>

        <p>I cut the mitres using the crappy mitre guage that came with my table saw. If I was doing this again I'd build a mitre sled.</p>

        <p>Each piece had a rebate cut on the table saw for the "glass" pane and backing board.</p>

        <p>Here's how I glued the mitres together, masking tape and an F clamp to keep them aligned. Can you see the mistake yet?</p>

        <p>Yeah that was a bit dumb.</p>

        <p>It was a lot easier than I'd like to pull apart that end grain to end grain glue joint. I expect if this frame gets dropped it'll just pop apart.</p>

        <a href="image08_full.jpg"><img src="image08.jpg" title="Click for full size" /></a>
        <p>After that happy little accident I glued the pieces on one by one to make sure I made a square this time.</p>

      <div class="image">
        <a href="image09_full.jpg"><img src="image09.jpg" title="Click for full size" /></a>
        <p>It's a bit gappy, this is why I'd built a mitre sled for future projects.</p>

      <div class="image">
        <a href="image10_full.jpg"><img src="image10.jpg" title="Click for full size" /></a>
        <p>I filled the gaps in with a wood glue and sawdust mixture.</p>

        <a href="image11_full.jpg"><img src="image11.jpg" title="Click for full size" /></a>
        <p>Finished with three coats of boiled linseed oil.</p>

      <div class="image">
        <a href="image12_full.jpg"><img src="image12.jpg" title="Click for full size" /></a>
        <p>The gaps are still a bit too obvious for my liking.</p>

        <p>Two little tabs are screwed on just loose enough that you can still turn them by hand to hold the backboard and a sheet of perspex in. The frame stands on two feet made of dowels and chunks of wood which can be moved to make the frame portrait or landscape.</p>

        <p>It's a little wobbly in portrait unless you fiddle with the feet to get them perfect but it's solid in landscape.</p>
