      <h1>Workbench</h1>
      <p>My first woodworking project. A workbench with a vise based on the design by Matthias Wandel at <a href="https://woodgears.ca/workbench/">https://woodgears.ca/workbench/</a></p>
      <p>Completed on 04/09/2016.</p>

        <p>I used a series of circulaw saw cuts to cut the dados for the legs in the aprons.</p>

        <p>Dados cleaned up using a chisel.</p>

        <p>Testing the fit. One was a perfect fit but the other three had a bit of wobble, they seemed good enough though.</p>

        <p>Seeing how everything will eventually look.</p>

        <p>The leg frames are held together with dowels and screws, this was me testing out drilling holes and driving screws on scrap pieces. I'm glad I did this because you can see how messy my first attempt was.</p>

      <div class="image">
        <a href="image07_full.jpg"><img src="image07.jpg" title="Click for full size" /></a>
        <p>After watching a youtube video about how to actually use a drill I got much better results.</p>

        <p>Putting the leg frames together I made a measuring error, it's a good thing I'd not glued the dowel in yet.</p>

      <div class="image">

        <p>Fixed.</p>

        <p>Starting to look more like a workbench now. The aprons are just attached with screws, not glued, so it can be disassembled.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="image">
        <a href="image12_full.jpg"><img src="image12.jpg" title="Click for full size" /></a>
        <p>The worktop is just 2 sheets of chipboard glued together. It's screwed into blocks of wood that were glued to the inside of the aprons.</p>

      <div class="image">
        <a href="image13_full.jpg"><img src="image13.jpg" title="Click for full size" /></a>
        <p>Added a shelf. I should have added this before the worktop, I had to make the corner cutouts longer than necessary to be able to maneuver it into place.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="image">

        <p>Fitted the vise. I got this vise in a sorry rusted up state for Â£10 on gumtree and cleaned it up. The quick-release mechanism does work but it's quite stiff, I'm going to try using paraffin wax to lube it to see if that's any better than the 3 in 1 oil it currently has. The vise is attached from the under side with lag screws through a mess of shims and then into the worktop.</p>

        <p>Added a tool rail from the leftover dowel I had.</p>

        <p>I had some trouble with wobble when I was done, but the uneven garage floor didn't help. In the right spot it's pretty stable and when there's stuff on the shelf weighing it down it's rock solid.</p>
