      <h1>Bootjack</h1>
      <p>A bootjack I made for my mums birthday, only 8 months late. Made from maple and walnut, finished with spray lacquer.</p>
      <p>Completed on 05/06/2017.</p>

        <p>I drew up a simple plan for the project to figure out all the dimensions.</p>

        <p>Ripped the pieces on the table saw then glued them up. I used way too much glue and got a lot of squeezeout.</p>

        <p>After I sanded away the excess glue there was a pretty bad slope on the piece, so I brought it back to flat with a hand plane.</p>

        <p>Marking up for the centre of the hole.</p>

        <p>I used a forstner bit in the drill press to make the hole, then attempted to cut the horns with a jigsaw. It didn't make a pretty job of it. I think my mistake was cutting from the outside towards the hole, maybe it would have been better cutting from the hole out.</p>

        <p>Using a coping saw got me a much cleaner result.</p>

        <p>After about 10 minutes of trying to clean up the shaping by hand with sandpaper I realised it was a bad idea and bought a sander set for the drill press. This works much better than I was expecting.</p>

        <p>The final shape involved removing more material than I had planned, as I based the original shape on the wrong boot so needed to narrow it down more.</p>

        <p>I cut a dado for the stand on the table saw and cleaned it up later with a chisel. I also cut tapers to each side on the table saw but did not get a picture of that.</p>

        <p>Getting this clamped up with the angle on the stand was a nightmare, I should have either cut the angle after gluing, or saved the angle offcut to tape back on with double sided tape for the glue up.</p>

        <p>I used a flush cut saw to cut off the excess of the stand and sandpaper taped to my workbench to make the angle of the stand perfect.</p>
